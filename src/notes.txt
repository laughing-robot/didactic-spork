0.5) WE HAVE TO FIX FRAMES (PER WALL BASIS: FRAME SPECIFIER OR LOCATION SPECIFIER)
1) have an ordered list of "spots to fill" for a room
2) we can just pass in x items and have the room display them
3) need a nice format to pass in the reddit portraits
4) need a way to track player location and generate rooms




PACKING RANDOMIZATION
1) top-level stuff (bins, sub-bins, etc.)
2) portrait sizes and scalings
3) portrait placements space

iterable placements w/ intuitive rescalings maybe?
which bin? => definitely needs some RANDOM

which free space? => this can be deterministic?

how to make placements 'iterable'
    o have to be able to 'undo' a placement

which free space to start at
how to search from a seed point

how to 'jump' to a totally different placement style?
i.e. how to randomly sample placement styles



STATE SPACE

STATE (example)
bins, bin style, portrait placements, unplaced portraits
some heuristic
priority queue
