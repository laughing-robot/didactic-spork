0.5) WE HAVE TO FIX FRAMES (PER WALL BASIS: FRAME SPECIFIER OR LOCATION SPECIFIER)
1) have an ordered list of "spots to fill" for a room
2) we can just pass in x items and have the room display them
3) need a nice format to pass in the reddit portraits
4) need a way to track player location and generate rooms
